    "# Split Neural Network (SplitNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, PySyft has been used to facilitate federated learning. However, we can also leverage the tools included in this framework to implement distributed neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a SplitNN?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/anatomy.png\" width=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The training of a neural network (NN) is 'split' accross a chain of multiple hosts. Each segment in the chain is a self contained NN that feeds into the segment in front. The host with the training data has the beginning segment of the network and the end segment. Intermediate segments of the chain are held by participating hosts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The SplitNN network is assembled as a chain of NNs, each feeding into the next. The data subject has both the beginning and the end of this chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/training.png\" width=\"80%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "When forward propogation commences, the data subject propogates the x values forward through the network at the start of the chain and sends their activation signals to the next intermediate host. This host feeds the recieved activation signal forward through their network and to the next link in the chain. This continues until the end of the chain is reached. The data subject then recieves an activation signal and forward propogates. They then compute the loss using their y-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "They backward propogate the gradients of the activation signals they recieved to the host previous to them in the chain. This host then computes their gradients, sending the gradient of the activeation signal backward. Eventually, the data subject recieves the gradients of their activation signal at the start of the chain and computes gradients. \n",
    "\n",
    "The NNs in the chain update their weights and biases, commenceing the next epoch. When a host is finished training, they pass the front and end segments to the next person with data to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/BatchFlow.png\" width=\"40%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use a SplitNN?\n",
    "\n",
    "The SplitNN has been shown to provide a dramatic reduction to the computational burden of training while maintaining higher accuracies when training over large number of clients [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00564)]. In the figure below, the Blue line denotes distributed deep learning using splitNN, red line indicate federated learning (FL) and green line indicates Large Batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (LBSGD).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/AccuracyvsFlops.png\" width=\"60%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/computation.png\" width=\"40%\">\n",
    " \n",
    "Table 1 shows computational resources consumed when training CIFAR 10 over VGG. Theses are a fraction of the resources of FL and LBSGD. Table 2 shows the bandwith usage when training CIFAR 100 over ResNet. Federated learning is less bandwidth intensive with fewer than 100 clients. However, the SplitNN outperforms other approaches as the number of clients grow[[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00564)].\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/bandwidth.png\" width=\"40%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this technique, nobody knows the input data and labels apart from the data subject. All that is sent or recieved between nodes is activation signals during forward propogation and their corresponding gradients during backpropogation. Entropy can be added to the activation signals through adding layers to the model segments. Entropy of training data could potentially be measured to arrive at the appropriate number of layers to use in order to adequately hide the orignal values in start and end segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this process, no hosts involved in the learning process have a full picture of the network. As a result there is very little risk of the model being stolen by participating hosts. Models could only be fully recovered by malicious participants if they were to collude with every other host. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- The accuracy should be almost identical to a non-split version of the same model, trained locally. \n",
    "- Models and data can be homomorphically encrypted for added security at the cost of added computation.\n",
    "- Model is distributed, meaning all segment holders must consent in order to aggregate the model at the end of training.\n",
    "- The scalability of this approach, in terms of both network and computational resources, could make this an a valid alternative to FL and LBSGD, particularly on low power devices.\n",
    "- Could be an effective mechanism for both horizontal and vertical data distributions.\n",
    "- As computational cost is already quite low, proportianate homomorphic encryption cost is also minimised.\n",
    "- Only activation signal gradients are sent/ recieved, meaning that malicious actors cannot use gradients of model parameters to reverse engineer the original values\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- A new technique with little surroundung literature, a large amount of compartison and evaluation is still to be done.\n",
    "- This approach requires all hosts to remain online during the entire learning process.\n",
    "    - makes approach less fesible for hand-held devices\n",
    "- Less established in toolkits than FL and LBSGD\n",
    "- While most aspects of the learning process are anonymised, the intermediary hosts are need to know the location of those ahead and behind to send and recieve data during learning. Ideally this would provide anonymity to participants.\n",
    "- This approach is less secure with small groups training but becomes more secure as the number of model segments increases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial \n",
    "\n",
    "The SpliNN has the capacity to be a significant contribution to the growing ecosystem of privacy preserving learning methodologies. This tutorial has three purposes;\n",
    "\n",
    "- To explain in as clear terms as possible what is going on during the training of a SplitNN.\n",
    "- To provide a working example of a SplitNN learning on arbitrary sets of; training data, model segments and data providers.\n",
    "- To provide an implementation of this technique on the PySyft framework so that this can be further validated against other techniques. \n",

When Alice passes segment 1 and 5 to Bob, Alice has prior knowledge of Segment 1. Then when Bob then passes his x values through and sends the resultant a values to segment 2 (Alice), Alice knows the model and resultant activation signal. Alice also knows the error being fed back so she can maintain knowledge of the model as it's. With the knowledge of the model and activation signals, Alice could reverse engineer Bob's x values.\n",
